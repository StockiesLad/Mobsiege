If you can't find any nearby, you can combine the bone meal you get from sand, and ash you get from charcoal pits. If you don't have enough ash, burn some wood in an open fire."

You need to dry it first with a drying rack. Once you have DRY clay bricks, then you can smelt it to get your bricks and hence your campfire rock."

It also needs to be sustained with fuels (Use your poor and low grade charcoal for this) to keep going. Making another grill is ideal as you can power it with your campfire. Thus, giving you double the throughput with the same amount of fuel."

While campfires can solve your temperature problems, you still need to quench your thirst. Smelt some sand in it to make glass shards, which can be used to make bottles for water. Since you cannot quite purify it yet, unfiltered will have to do for now."
