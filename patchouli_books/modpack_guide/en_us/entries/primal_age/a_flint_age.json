Keep in mind, using a knife makes them drop more. To get your flint, mine gravel, which will also sometimes drop pebbles. Keep these for later as it's used to make a grill."

After that, knapp your flint by right-clicking on any stone-like material to break it into shards, then do it again for some pointed flint. Don't knapp all your flint, you will need a little bit of all 3 variants (Flint, Flint Shards & Pointed Flint)."

As for your hatchet, create 2 of them as you will need it for crafting as well. Due to it's weak nature, flint tools damage randomly (inverse of unbreaking) and can break easily. This is what the 'Unreliable' tooltip means."
