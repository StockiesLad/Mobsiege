In spite of it being rather expensive, it is well worth it. The first function is the repulsion of all hostile mobs away from a designated distance like an invisible force field. It's second function is to protect whichever chunk its in against mobsieges. I.e mobsieges cannot occur in a chunk that is protected by an interdiction torch. Due to its nature, you can place it deep underground, sacrificing its force-field effect for the guaranteed mobsiege prevention."
