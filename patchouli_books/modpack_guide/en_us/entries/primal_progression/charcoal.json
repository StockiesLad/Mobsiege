So, staying out in the open will almost certainly lead to death. Consequently, burying yourself under the dirt is not necessarily ideal either as mobs can and will tunnel to you. But, if you go to deep into the darkness, the grue will eat you!"

Keep one block exposed so that you can light it. To do this, sneak and use your fire starter of choice to light them, you'll know it's done right if smoke particles are present. Once ignited, patch it up so there are no holes."
