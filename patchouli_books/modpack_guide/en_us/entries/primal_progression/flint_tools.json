And to get one, you're going to need 3 things: flint, sticks & plant fiber. Start by breaking any loose grass around you. As you do that, make your way to some gravel so that you can also get yourself some flint."

After a couple times you should have flint shards. As for your plant fiber, put 3 of them in your 2x2 crafting grid to create plant string."

Use a campfire to smelt plant string into As you may have noticed, saws are generally more effecient for this purpose, so try to get one first chance you get! This concept also applies for clay bricks later on."
