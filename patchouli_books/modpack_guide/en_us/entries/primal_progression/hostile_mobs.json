Skeletons have aimbot, spiders move like real life and are way faster. There are also many more variations of mobs of all sorts that are also eager to kill you and none of them burn at daytime. Oh, they also spawn in bigger groups and more frequently."

Mobs spawn in groups of their respective species (slimes, blazes, creepers, etc) in amounts of up to 25 individual mobs. A mobsiege is very dangerous, especially because fire and tnt is used frequently. So if you die, your items probably will too. So just run away!"
