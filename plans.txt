AFTER THE FOLLOWING IS COMPLETED, WE ARE MOSTLY DONE

complex recipes {
	turrets
}

primitive fighting tools {
	Slime Bomb (gunpowder + sap/slime): less explosion, higher yield; leaves behind charred sap that slows hostile mobs
	Phosphorus Flares - (high grade charcoal + bonemeal (Phosphorus) + nickel dust): shoots fire in a given direction for a certain amount of time
	Frag Explosive - (tnt + glass shards): primitive grenade shoots glass everywhere, doing high damage to mobs
	
}

unify ash
maybe make more stages (earlygame, midgame, endgame) --> (primal, forgery, basic machines, advanced machines, magic, completion)
add proper tech progression (tinkers construct & buildcraft -> create & immersive engineering -> projectred & industrial foregoing -> magic cubes & ae2)
progression structure {
	complex alloys, basic components and quartz-variants are used to build basic machines/redstone - produces advanced components and deep resonance crystals (turrets & guns, basic jetpacks, mob grinding, elevators)
	advanced components, hyper-complex alloys & chips are used to produce magic cubes and a ae2 me system (interdiction torches and portals, advanced jetpacks & ae2)
fix enderium catch 22 with component assembly.
get back to expanded storage 2/2 in later mechanical/electrical branches
fix coal input in ad astra steel smelting
add a way to chop logs into split logs via machines
add more heating sources
make epic siege monsters specifically target machine blocks
enable magnets are project red and foregoing
incorporate clouds in crafting
balance (deep resonance, industrial foregoing, thermal expansion, integrated dynamics, enderio, bigger reactors, rftools, solarflux, simply jetpacks, ad astra, systeams, mob grinding utils, ae2)
use resources from (betterend, betternether, projecte, bedrockium & aether &  magical utilities)
make mobs spawn with modded armor
two player cannot be in same server ?

for some reason stone is hidden (idk why)
fix actually additions weird access

# FINISHED TASKS! ---------------------------------------------------------------- FINISHED TASKS!

fix recipe printing
fix buildcraft fake explosion
lengthen explosion time to be exponential (raise a constant (1 + 1/x)^p - 1 (max 1))
integrate auto crafter deeply (consider buildcraft one too)
look into ranged pumps, pipez, flux networks and energy meter
progression structure {
	primal core 2 gets basic resources, albeit very primitive. (mining and survival)
	buildcraft gets resources and lava to process resources en mass with tinkers construct (buckets)
	alloys are used for building immersive engineering and create components via crafting and casting - creates basic components (automation)
}

supa important aether ores (this needs to be a thing if aether is to be a viable starting dimension) or creatively use tinkers construct to make it more interesting (I like this better)
change from esm config to epicsiegemod config
add all chests (I have tags for this), all furnaces and workbenches to epic siege
Make hostile mobs faster (including angered passive mobs) and super dangerous
fix weird issue where u sometimes cant use creative mode flying properly

fix old inputs for: weapon_printer.js, power_matter
account for ablaze
add gravel, flint, clay & pebble support for aether  (u already have a tag for holystone)
make no tree punching - like pebbles for nether & end maybe???
add soulsoil dust for nether
make holy pebble spawn like no tree punchings's one (work on this next)
fix insertions
need textures for holy pebble and quicksoil dust
disable aether redux menu
fix twigs and notreepunching rock duplicates
